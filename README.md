I’m Abdul Salam from Ghana. I am a Web 3 Enthusiast passionate about innovative technologies. Currently, I am learning and using the MERN Stack to build dynamic web applications. With experience in both frontend and backend development, particularly with Next.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS, I am always looking to collaborate on open source projects and contribute to the developer community.
